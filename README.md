 Key Analysis Steps

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

   * Handled missing values (brands, user attributes)
   * Extracted temporal features (year, month, date)
   * Standardized numerical features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Distribution of ratings
   * Top categories and brands
   * Yearly and monthly trends in reviews

3. Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

   * Optimal number of clusters: 6 (Silhouette Score: 0.82)
   * Segments identified: Loyal Fans, Silent Buyers, Critical Reviewers, Casual Positives, New Users, Mixed Raters

4. Visualization

   * Histograms, bar plots, time-series plots
   * Cluster scatter plots (n\_reviews\_log vs avg\_rating)
   * Boxplots to compare rating behaviors across clusters
